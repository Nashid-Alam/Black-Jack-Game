# Black Jack
## Date 11/17/21

### **Description** 
I will be creating a game of Black Jack. 
The game will have 2 players. A deck of 52 cards.At each turn the dealer(computer) will display a card to each player.They will tell the dealer whether to hit or to stand their turn. The dealer will keep displaying cards until one of the players reach 21 (sum of the cards display).

***
### **Game Rules**
* Points for the players will be assigned per the number on the card. Jacks,Kings and Queens are 10 points. A is an 11 or a 1 depending on what the player chooses.
* At each turn player one will be displayed a card, they can choose to "hit" or "stand". Hit will let them have another card and add that card to the score. A stand will keep the current card and number.
* On the first player reaching the score of 21 the game will reset and add a score for that player on the score borad
